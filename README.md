## Features

### Human-Led Coding Workflow — `?` / `??` / `?!` / `$`

A human-led coding workflow where the user decides when to discuss, plan, revise,
and execute. Normal prompts keep pi's default behavior; the workflow only activates
when a prefix is used.

| Input | Behavior |
|-------|----------|
| `? <text>` | Discuss/analyze only — read-only exploration, no plan required |
| `?? <text>` | Write a new reviewable plan, replacing any active plan |
| `??` | Write a plan from the most recent `?` discussion, if available |
| `?! <text>` | Revise the current active plan from explicit review feedback |
| `$` | Execute the current active plan |
| `$ <text>` | Execute the current active plan with extra constraints |

- **Human-led control**: ordinary input remains free-form; plan feedback requires `?!`; execution requires `$`
- **Read-only discussion/planning/revision**: these modes allow `read`, `grep`, `find`, `ls`, safe read-only `bash`, and `webfetch`, while blocking `edit`, `write`, and unsafe commands
- **Reviewable plan structure**: plans include Goals, Background, Key Decisions, Non-goals, Implementation Steps, Acceptance Criteria, Verification, and Risks, ending with `Ready to execute?`
- **Execution summary**: execution responses are guided to include Summary, Modified Files, and Follow-up Suggestions; commits remain manual
- **Prefix-cache friendly**: the extension never mutates the system prompt, never switches active tools, filters stale workflow context messages from provider context, and stores state in custom entries outside LLM context
- **Editor border colors**: purple for `?`, orange for `??`, yellow for `?!`, blue for `$`
- **Chinese IME friendly**: full-width `？` `！` `￥` typed at the start of the editor are converted to `?` `!` `$`, including `？？` → `??` and `？！` → `?!`

### Locale — Stable Same-Language Policy

Adds a byte-stable language policy to the system prompt: reply in the same language
the user is using, while preserving technical identifiers exactly. The extension no
longer injects OS-specific hidden messages every turn, which keeps the prompt prefix
stable for provider prefix-cache/APC systems.

### Git Commit — `/git-commit`

Generates a terse [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) message
from staged changes via a direct LLM call (isolated from main session context), then
executes the commit. Uses "caveman-commit" style — ultra-compressed, subject ≤50 chars,
body only when the "why" isn't obvious. No AI attribution, no emoji, no fluff.

Optionally pass extra context: `/git-commit refactor for performance`.

### Command Mappings — Declarative Aliases

Registers command aliases via a declarative array in one extension, instead of creating
one file per alias. Currently provides `/exit` as an alias for the built-in `/quit`.
Add new mappings by appending entries to the `COMMAND_MAPPINGS` array.

### Focus Mode — Minimal Tool Rendering

Overrides all 7 built-in tools (read, bash, edit, write, grep, find, ls) to replace the
default green-background Box with a single dim-text line per tool call. Tool output is
hidden entirely. Multiple consecutive tool calls appear flush together with no spacing.
Paths are shortened (`~/` for home, truncation for long paths), commands are collapsed.
File paths are rendered as clickable OSC 8 `file://` hyperlinks in supported terminals.

Custom tools can reuse the same dim rendering via shared utilities from `wow/renderer.ts`
(`createFocusRenderCall`, `focusRenderResult`).

| Before (default) | After (focus mode) |
|------------------|-------------------|
| Green background Box per tool | Single `theme.fg("dim", ...)` line |
| Tool call + output preview | Tool call only (1 line) |
| 3+ lines per tool, spaced apart | 1 line per tool, flush together |

**Usage:**
- Load via `package.json` (enabled automatically)
- Use `Ctrl+O` to fold/expand (results remain hidden with this override)
- Use `Ctrl+T` to hide thinking blocks (in combination with `hideThinkingBlock` setting)

### Prefix Cache — Reasonix-Style Prompt Stability

Optimizes provider prefix-cache hit rate, especially for DeepSeek/OpenAI-compatible
reasoning models:

- Strips assistant `thinking` / `reasoning_content` from the provider context copy while preserving it in the local session/UI
- Canonicalizes OpenAI-compatible provider tool schemas and sorts tools by name for deterministic payload bytes
- Caps text tool results at 32KB in LLM context and saves oversized full output to a temp file
- Keeps workflow modes from switching active tools; safety is enforced by `tool_call` gates instead
- Provides `/cache-stats` for session cache usage and `/cache-doctor` for common stability problems

**Development rule:** future extensions should avoid per-turn system prompt mutations,
active tool switching, nondeterministic tool schemas, and oversized tool results.
Put dynamic mode state in user/custom turn-tail messages or runtime gates instead.

### Footer — Custom Status Bar

Replaces the built-in footer with a custom two-line layout using a dedicated color palette:

**Line 1**: working directory (yellow, clickable `file://` link) + git branch (purple) … LLM model + thinking level (green, right-aligned)

**Line 2**: context usage progress bar (green → yellow → red) + percentage + token I/O (blue) + cache hit rate (green) + cost (yellow) … extension statuses (dim)

The CWD path is shortened (`~/` for home) and rendered as an OSC 8 hyperlink for
one-click open in supporting terminals. A 10-character Unicode progress bar (`█░`)
shows context window usage at a glance — always visible, color-coded by threshold.
When the terminal is narrow, the left side truncates to guarantee the model name
stays visible on the right.

### WebFetch — Fetch Web Content

Fetches content from a URL and converts to the requested format (markdown, text, or html).
Built on Node.js native `fetch` — HTML conversion powered by node-html-markdown
(AST-based) for reliable, high-quality output.

**Features:**
- User-Agent spoofing and Accept header negotiation for best content type
- Cloudflare 403 bot-detection retry with honest UA fallback
- 5MB response size limit, configurable timeout (default 30s, max 120s)
- 32KB LLM-context output limit; full oversized output is saved to a temp file
- Raster image detection with base64 encoding
- URL parameters rendered as clickable hyperlinks in supported terminals
- Allowed during human-led workflow exploration; write safety is enforced by runtime gates, not active-tool switching

**Parameters:**

| Parameter | Default | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| `url` | (required) | The URL to fetch content from |
| `format` | `"markdown"` | Output format: `markdown`, `text`, or `html` |
| `timeout` | 30 | Timeout in seconds (max 120) |

## Architecture

### Shared Utility Layer — `extensions/wow/`

The package uses a centralized base extension (`wow`) that provides shared utilities
for all other extensions. It registers nothing at runtime and has no side effects —
it serves purely as an import source for common functions.

| Sub-module | Exports | Used by |
|------------|---------|---------|
| `locale.ts` | `detectLocale`, `detectPrimaryLocale`, `localeToDisplayName`, `buildLanguageInstruction`, `buildStableLanguagePolicy`, `LOCALE_MAP` | locale |
| `renderer.ts` | `createFocusRenderCall`, `focusRenderCall`, `focusRenderResult` | focus-mode, webfetch |
| `paths.ts` | `shortenPath`, `linkPath`, `shortenCommand` | focus-mode, footer |
| `html.ts` | `convertHTMLToMarkdown`, `extractTextFromHTML`, `stripTags`, `isRasterImage`, `STRIP_TAGS` | webfetch |
| `shell.ts` | `execOrNull`, `execWithError` | git-commit |
| `safe.ts` | `isSafeCommand` | human-led-coding-workflow, plan-mode shim |

Each sub-module can be imported directly by relative path:

```typescript
import { detectPrimaryLocale } from "../wow/locale.ts";
import { createFocusRenderCall, focusRenderResult } from "../wow/renderer.ts";
import { shortenPath, linkPath } from "../wow/paths.ts";
import { convertHTMLToMarkdown } from "../wow/html.ts";
import { execOrNull, execWithError } from "../wow/shell.ts";
import { isSafeCommand } from "../wow/safe.ts";
```

Or import everything from the unified entry:

```typescript
import { detectLocale, createFocusRenderCall, shortenPath } from "../wow/index.ts";
```

## Development

```bash
# After editing extensions, run /reload or restart pi
```

### Conventions

- **Dialogue**: user-AI communication follows the user's current language
- **Technical content**: code, comments, config, documentation, commit messages use English
- **Code style**: TypeScript, following existing conventions
- **Shared utilities**: all reusable functions live in `extensions/wow/` — import from there, don't duplicate
- **Prefix-cache safety**: do not add per-turn timestamps/random IDs/locale-specific text to the system prompt; do not switch active tools for modes; truncate custom tool output before returning it to the LLM
